# FlashBrowser
Electron Flash Browser by Maatt

Big thanks to Maatt. 

This is my personal version based on the original repo.

I only have updated a newer and 64-bit-only version of flash.dll into this repo, for some cases that using the older version flash won't work. But I don't have a 32-bit environment, so I'm not finding usable 32-bit flash library and removing support from this repo.

## Changing List:

- Newer flash.dll flash library (pulled from another Chinese web mini game's electron client)
- Set startup homepage to Bing (due to google is unavailable in some countries)

## How to use:

Download the pre-built executables from [here](https://github.com/nonefffds/FlashBrowser/releases/download/v1.0.0/Flash-Browser-1.0.1.zip), unzip it, then click on the Flash Browser.exe

I don't have time to pack this into an installer, as long as it works.
